The intellectual Property Assignment is made and entered into as 2/18/2019, by and between Jonathan R. Roman Velez and Kelvin Martinez.

The Parties hereby agree as follows:

1.	Both parties agree to own half of everything related to the software that will be developed as a group. This include the software, 
    algorithms, concepts, improvements, designs, logos, formulas and codes. 

2.	In the case the software were to be sold to a third party, both parties agree to split the earnings in half. 

3.	Both parties agree to own copy of receipts if the software or anything related to it were to be sold. 
 
4.	In the case that one of the members leave “the group”, the member that left has claim of the software until that point. 
   Meaning that any further improvement of the software will be owned by the person who made the improvements. 
   If the software is further improved by one of the team members and the other teammate leaves, 
   the person who worked on continuing to develop the software can sell the resulting software to a third party. 
   If this were the case the member that left will only have claim to twenty-five percent of the earnings.

5.	The software is to be used for educational purposes until the end of the “project”, if a third party is interested on buying 
    the software both Jonathan Roman and Kelvin Martinez will have to host a meeting to speak about the selling process. 

6.	If another party were to be interested in joining, both parties should discuss and agree on the conditions of adding a new member, 
    including but not limited to: the percentage of the software the new member will have and the role the member will hold on 
    the development of the software.
